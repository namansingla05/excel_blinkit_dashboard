## Insights & Suggestions Based on Data

1. **Outlet Type Focus**:
   - *Supermarket Type 1* generates the highest sales ($787.5K). Investment in expanding or replicating this model could increase revenue.

2. **Fat Content Preference**:
   - *Regular fat content* items account for 65% of total sales. While low-fat options are significant, there's a clear preference for regular products. This could guide future inventory decisions.

3. **Location-Wise Opportunity**:
   - *Tier 3 locations* have the highest sales ($472.1K), followed by Tier 2 and Tier 1. There is potential to further strengthen presence in Tier 3 cities through targeted marketing or outlet expansion.

4. **Item-Type Optimization**:
   - *Fruits & Vegetables* and *Snack Foods* are top-selling categories. Lesser performing categories like *Seafood*, *Breakfast*, and *Starchy Foods* might need reevaluation or promotional efforts to boost sales.

5. **Outlet Size Strategy**:
   - *Medium* and *High* outlet sizes contribute significantly. Optimization of small outlets may include reviewing item selection or local demand analytics.

6. **Time-Based Performance**:
   - Peak establishment sales occurred around 2018. Analyze external factors or business strategies from that period to replicate success.
